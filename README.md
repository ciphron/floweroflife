# Overlapping Circles and the Flower of Life
This code draws the triangular lattice form of overlapping circles along with the flower of life pattern. Hopefully, it may be useful to somebody. This code requires the geom2d module and its implementations, which are available at https://github.com/ciphron/geom2d. From the geom2d repository, copy the geom2d and geom2dimpl directories into your working directory. See my blog post at http://ciphron.netsoc.ie/blog?post=flower for a description of the algorithms that are used and further information.

# Prerequisites
geom2d and geom2dimpl (https://github.com/ciphron/geom2d)
geom2dimpl requires PIL and svgwrite (pip install svgwrite Pillow)
